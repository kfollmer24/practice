# practice
I am using this repo to practice the actions that I will take in my projects production repo

In the edit_1 branch I am keeping the edits that I am sure of

In the edit_2 branch I am playing around by not sure

I want to push edit_2 into edit_1 locally, and then edit_1 on github online to potentially move to practice once it's reviewed
